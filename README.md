#CS201 PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 6
* 85 POINTS total
* Choice and partner: Chosen in lab, 11/22
* Partner Agreement and Plan: Wednesday, 11/30
* Design: Wednesday, 11/30
* Final: Wednesday, 12/7, 11:59PM
* Presentation: Friday, 12/9 (files due by 10AM, presentations occur in class)

## OVERVIEW: 
The problem to be solved will vary from group to group. In this assignment, you will work with 1 other person in your section of the course. There will be 1 group of 3 since we have an odd number of students. The group of 3 will have a larger amount of code to write.

## PURPOSE OF THE ASSIGNMENT
This assignment will give you practice with the vast majority of Python topics from this course. 
It will also give you one last chance to show that you have learned how to pair program.
This assignment gives you an opportunity to present your work to your classmates.

## CHOOSING THE PROBLEM
Every group in each section of the course must work on a different project. By the end of lab on Tuesday 11/22 you need to have formed a group and chosen a project.  
They are all of the same difficulty, but need different approaches to solve them. 
Dr. Olsen will make your repository with the appropriate input files during lab. Options will be displayed during lab.

## PARTNER AGREEMENT (5pts)
Every group is required to fully fill out a partner agreement that includes information on how you plan to divide up the work, and when you plan to meet.
You must assign a lead programmer to each function. This person is the driver on that function.
Partners should be helping each other on all aspects of the program -- don't leave your partner hanging, or try to do their work for them. Support each other.
You and your partner should divide the work evenly, ideally working in a pair programming style.

Partner agreement due at deadline above. You must fill out the provided form in GitHub. 
Dr. Olsen will tell you if your plan is OK or if you need to make changes.

## DESIGN (10pts)
You must submit:
* partner.txt: Your partner agreement as described in the prior section
* design.txt: A list of functions with function name, purpose, parameters (describe), and return value (describe). The names here should match the names used in your partner agreement to list who will be lead programmer.
* A .py file that properly reads from your input file, stores that information in an appropriate list (list of lists, list of words, etc -- depends on your data), and outputs the list to the user so you can see that it works. User input of a filename should be fully implemented with error checking, and no user input or output should occur in the file processing function. You should have 3 implemented functions at this point.

## ASSIGNMENT REMINDERS & WORKING AS A PAIR/GROUP
* Follow the programming assignment requirements document for comments, formatting, etc. You will need to add function comments above each function in your code. 
* For each function in your PA you MUST list the author of that function. Be very clear about who was involved in each step.
* You will be required to fill out a survey privately about working with your partner (you may NOT take this survey together, or show your submission to your partner). 
  * I am expecting you to be honest. I may ask you for a meeting during finals week to discuss. 
  * This survey is due by the start of class on Monday, 12/12. 
  * The survey will be on Moodle. 
  * If you are a very bad partner, you will not get full credit for the PA (this includes both taking over the project and not letting your partner do anything, and failing to fulfill your part of the project). 
  * *You will have a zero for the PA until you fill out this survey.*

## PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS
After your design is complete, it’s time to start programming and then testing:

1. Implementation: Write your program following the below requirements and based on your design.
  * Follow good usability/HCI principles in designing your input and output
  * Practice iterative development: Instead of coding everything at once, code 1 part, get it to work right, then start the next part. For instance, code and test one question at a time.  Look back at the steps given to you in recent labs.
2. Your program should work for ANY file of this format; if I gave you a new file of the same format, it should work without any changes.
  * You should not assume the number of lines will be identical. 
  * Note how the files for your particular problem are delimited. 
3. Input: The user should provide names of input, output, or plot files. User input should be error checked as defined for your particular problem.
4. Output: You must state the purpose of the program, You must make your output as clear as possible.  
5. Testing: Does it store the data correctly? Does it calculate the answers correctly? Test it! Dr. Olsen certainly will test it when she grades it...
6. Comments: In addition to the normal comments, **each function should list who was in charge of programming it.** If both partners worked together in pair programming fashion, list both partners.

## FINAL PRESENTATION (10pts)
On Friday 12/9 you and your partner will present the results of your data analysis PA to the rest of the class.
Since everyone is working on a different problem, you will need to describe the problem, the approach you took to designing a solution, and the results (what did you learn about the data you analyzed? don't just show values, interpret them. Beware that you don't introduce bias in your interpretation). 
Exact details of the presentation format will be posted that week. 
Your presentation grade will be based on the content of your presentation, the style of your presentation, and whether or not you pay attention and give feedback on your classmates’ presentations during the class period. 
This part of your grade may be different between partners. 
**You must submit your group’s presentation file(s) to Dr. Olsen via email by 10AM that morning. **

## EXTRA CREDIT
There are many opportunities to be creative and thoughtful when programming. There is rarely one right way to solve a problem, although usually some approaches are better than others.  If I find that you have been particularly creative (in a positive way) or thoughtful in any of the following manners, I will give you extra credit for each that you accomplish:

1. Particularly well commented, and organized code
2. Particularly good/clear output, including excellent prompts
3. Particularly excellent design, which includes great efficiency or data structure choices 
4. Particularly well done presentation

## SUBMIT   
Your final submission of your code and reflection is due on Wednesday December 7 at 11:59PM. 
If you or your partner has a remaining late pass, you may use it on the final submission of this assignment. 
You may use at most 1 late pass (making it due Friday at the start of class), although I highly recommend completing it on time so it doesn’t eat into your presentation preparation time. 
*You may not use a late pass on the presentation.*

To GitHub (Wednesday 12/7, 11:59PM):
* Your .py file

Email (Friday 12/9, 10AM):
* A copy of your presentation PowerPoint and any other necessary presentation materials to Dr. Olsen via email, by Wednesday 12/9 at 10AM.	

Hardcopy in class (Friday 12/9):
* A printout of your .py file
* Your reflection. Please reflect on how this assignment brought together many aspects of what you learned this semester in computer science, what was the hardest to do, and what was surprisingly easy given how hard it had been earlier in the semester. This reflection should be longer than prior assignment reflections. (1 per person)

Moodle (Monday 12/12):
* The form rating your and your partners’ ability to work as a team (Moodle). This is where you will reflect on the pair programming aspect of the assignment.
