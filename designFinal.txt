My Question: The percentage of each gender who survived in the format "XX.X%"

Function Name: File Processing
Parameters: input file name and new file name
Return: none
Algorithm:
1. Try:
    a. Open the file input by the user
    b. Open the new file to write
    c. Set total survived count to zero
    d. Set class1 survived to zero
    e. Set class 1 total to zero
    f. Set class2 survived to zero
    g. set class 2 total to zero
    h. Set class3 survived to zero
    i. set class 3 total to zero
    j. Set total passengers to zero
    k. Set females equal to zero
    l. set females survived to zero
    m. Set males survived to zero
    n. Set males equal to zero
    o. For line in input file
        i. Split by the "|" and store as Class, Survived, Name, Sex, Age, Embark, Dest
        ii. Add one to total passengers
        iii. if female
            1. add one to female
        iv. otherwise
            1. add one to male
        v. if class 1
            1. add one to class 1 total
        vi. otherwise if class 2
            1. add one to class 2 total
        vii. otherwise
            1. add one to class 3 total
        viii. if they survived
            1. output to new file the name and destination
            2. add one to total survivors
            3. if female
                a. add one to female survived
            4. if male
                a. add one to male survived
            5. if class is 1
                a. Add one to class1 survived
            6. otherwise if class is 2
                a. Add one to class2 survived
            7. otherwise if class is 3
                a.Add one to class3 survived
    p. if class 1 total isn't zero
        i. Calculate percent of class 1 that survived by class1 survived/ class 1 total x100
    q. otherwise
        i. set percent to zero
    r. if class 2 total isn't zero
        i. Calculate percent of class 2 that survived by class2 survived/ class 2 total x100
    s. otherwise
        i. set percent to zero
    t. if class 3 total isn't zero
        i. Calculate percent of class 3 that survived by class3 survived/ class 3 total x100
    u. otherwise
        i. set percent to zero
    v. if females isn't zero
        i. Calculate percentage of females survived by females survived/ females x 100
    w. otherwise
        i. set percent to zero
    x. if males isn't zero
        i. Calculate percentage of males survived by males survived / males x 100
    y. Output total survivors
    z. Output percent of class1 survived
    aa. Output percent of class2 survived
    bb. Output percent of class3 survived
    cc. Output percentage survived of males
    dd. Output percentage survived of females
    ee. close input file
    ff. close new file
2. except FileNotFoundError:
    a. output error message
    b. end program

Purpose: Error check if file exists
Parameters: none
Return: file name
Algorithm:
1. Ask the user for the file with the students names
2. While the file doesnt exist
    a. Ask the user for a new file name
3. Return file name

Function Name: Main
Parameters: none
Return: none
1. Output the purpose
2. Ask user to input the file to be read
3. Ask user to input the new file name
4. Call file processing function

RUN MAIN
