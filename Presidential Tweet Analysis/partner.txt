PA6 Partner Agreement

By filling out this agreement, both partners agree to abide by the honor code and to work together on this project.
Both partners will, to the best of their ability, support the other person in this PA as well as committing to do their own fair share of the work.
Both partners agree that any issues that occur that they cannot resolve between themselves will be brought up to Dr. Olsen in a timely manner so that she can assist.
Both partners understand that their best way to get help from Dr. Olsen if they get stuck is to go to office hours.

The lead programmer is the main person responsible for a given function. However, the function should still be written either with pair programming, or with the other partner helping and answering questions. 
The lead programmer should be the one to drive that function, which includes doing all typing.
Both partners agree to take the lead on their assigned functions, AND to help their partner on the other functions.
