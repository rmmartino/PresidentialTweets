#CS201 PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 6
Assignment Description written by Dr. Olsen to outline the purpose of the assignment

## PURPOSE OF THE ASSIGNMENT
This assignment will give you practice with the vast majority of Python topics from this course. 
It will also give you one last chance to show that you have learned how to pair program.
This assignment gives you an opportunity to present your work to your classmates.

## PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS
After your design is complete, itâ€™s time to start programming and then testing:

1. Implementation: Write your program following the below requirements and based on your design.
  * Follow good usability/HCI principles in designing your input and output
  * Practice iterative development: Instead of coding everything at once, code 1 part, get it to work right, then start the next part. For instance, code and test one question at a time.  Look back at the steps given to you in recent labs.
2. Your program should work for ANY file of this format; if I gave you a new file of the same format, it should work without any changes.
  * You should not assume the number of lines will be identical. 
  * Note how the files for your particular problem are delimited. 
3. Input: The user should provide names of input, output, or plot files. User input should be error checked as defined for your particular problem.
4. Output: You must state the purpose of the program, You must make your output as clear as possible.  
5. Testing: Does it store the data correctly? Does it calculate the answers correctly? Test it! Dr. Olsen certainly will test it when she grades it...
6. Comments: In addition to the normal comments, **each function should list who was in charge of programming it.** If both partners worked together in pair programming fashion, list both partners.
